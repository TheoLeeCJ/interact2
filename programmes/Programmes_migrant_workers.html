                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>The first prevalent problem is that migrant workers are <strong style="color: #404040;">subject to labour right abuses and unfair treatment 
                                by employers.¹</strong> Such labour right abuses can include restriction of movement and confiscation of passports. This means that migrant workers have to 
                                report to their superiors before they are able to go anywhere, which poses a high level of danger to the migrant workers if their superiors are not 
                                free in cases of emergencies. The restriction of freedom also violates the human rights of migrant workers. Abuse from employers can also come in the 
                                form of insufficient work injury payouts. When the migrant workers are injured, they cannot work and thus rely on payouts to sustain their livelihood. 
                                If there are insufficient payouts, the basic living standards of migrant workers could be at risk. </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Secondly, the migrant workers face <strong style="color: #404040;">exploitation by employers rooted in an inherent power asymmetry between employers and employees. 
                                This can be caused by many factors, such as the fact that </strong>migrant workers owe a lot of money to employment agencies for bringing them from their home country to 
                                Singapore and getting them jobs. For context, some paid as much as $10000 in agent fees to work in Singapore, 20 times their paycheck. The huge debt is exacerbated 
                                by the fact that in order to pay for the high fees, many had to sell jewelry or land, borrow money from relatives, or take out bank loans, adding to the pressure on the 
                                worker to make money in Singapore. In addition, their pay can be very low, as low as $18 per day, or $540 per month for hard manual labour.² This low pay is a result of 
                                an absence of a minimum wage in Singapore. Yet, migrant workers frequently work very long hours, incentivised by their huge debt. The imbalance between the long hours 
                                that the workers work and their low pay points to exploitation of migrant workforce by employers, such as repatriation threats made, leading to a significant disadvantage 
                                for foreign workers during employer-employee negotiations.</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>There is, fortunately, a maximum working hour limit for “foreign workers working under contract with an employer” in Singapore. 
                                Work time is capped at 44 hours a week by law.³ Nevertheless, the power imbalance between employers and employees also results in underpayment or a complete lack of 
                                salary for an extended period of time. Many will put up with the employer's assurances, for some number of months, that they will be paid the full amount. Some 
                                eventually made claims after their employers stopped paying or as they realised that their promises will never come to fruition. </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Many also face severe difficulties when seeking new employers. For those who did manage to find new employers, 
                                many would be broke as the lack of salaries caused them to exhaust their savings. This serves as a factor that reduces their ability to find new 
                                jobs due to the nature of employment agencies - they demand upfront payment of excessive agency fees⁴ before agreeing to place them with employers. </p>

                                otherwise unseen by the masses, was recently brought to public attention due to the COVID situation. Foreign worker 
                                <strong style="color: #404040;">dormitories are cramped and enclosed</strong>, with many workers sharing the same room, packed into bunk beds. Currently, it is 
                                estimated that there are 200,000 migrant workers housed in 43 purpose-built dormitories around Singapore.⁶</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Nevertheless, it is to be noted that there have been governmental measures to ensure the quality of 
                                living conditions of the migrant workers. Licensed dormitories housing more than 1,000 workers each are required to comply with the 
                                requirements under the Foreign Employee Dormitory Act (FEDA), such as providing facilities that include sick bays and isolation rooms.⁷</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>The effectiveness of these measures, especially when put to the test, is still in question. Taking the COVID 
                                period as an example, <strong style="color: #404040;">the cramped and stale conditions in the dormitories have contributed to the rapid spread of COVID</strong> in the migrant dorms causing 
                                large scale outbreaks. By the end of April 2020, the number of coronavirus cases in Singapore increased by 15 times, swelling from 1,000 to more than 15,000 cases. 
                                By May 2020, it had the largest number of cases of any country in Southeast Asia – with more than 90% of infections within the migrant workforce.⁸ Since the outbreaks 
                                amongst the migrant workers started, the migrant workers have been living under tight restrictions for more than 18 months, even as most of them are fully vaccinated. 
                                The separate treatment of these workers is evident; with Singapore striving to transit to a “new normal” and many looking forward to further easing of pandemic-related 
                                restrictions, the situation has not changed much for the 275,000-odd migrant workers living in dormitories.</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Since last year, the workers have been mostly confined to their rooms due to the restrictions imposed, and only allowed to 
                                leave for work or, for stipulated recreation centres on some days. This has <strong style="color: #404040;">impacted their mental health negatively⁹</strong>. In view of this, as well as their poor living 
                                conditions, participants can consider possible actions that we can take to improve their situation. Community projects that participants can contemplate include 
                                meaningful engagement sessions with the migrant workers and raising more awareness about the plight of the migrant workers. </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Other issues include questions <strong style="color: #404040;">about hygiene in the dormitories</strong>. Factory Converted Dormitories (“FCDs”) – a type of accommodation 
                                that is already regulated by the FEDA – are plagued by serious hygiene-related issues. During the 2021 Committee of Supply, it was revealed that stray animals were found 
                                to freely roam in certain FCD kitchens, in addition to unclean food preparation and disposal areas.¹⁰</p>

                                living conditions of the migrant workers. Licensed dormitories housing more than 1,000 workers each are required to comply with the 
                                requirements under the Foreign Employee Dormitory Act (FEDA), such as providing facilities that include sick bays and isolation rooms.⁷</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>The effectiveness of these measures, especially when put to the test, is still in question. Taking the COVID 
                                period as an example, <strong style="color: #404040;">the cramped and stale conditions in the dormitories have contributed to the rapid spread of COVID</strong> in the migrant dorms causing 
                                large scale outbreaks. By the end of April 2020, the number of coronavirus cases in Singapore increased by 15 times, swelling from 1,000 to more than 15,000 cases. 
                                By May 2020, it had the largest number of cases of any country in Southeast Asia – with more than 90% of infections within the migrant workforce.⁸ Since the outbreaks 
                                amongst the migrant workers started, the migrant workers have been living under tight restrictions for more than 18 months, even as most of them are fully vaccinated. 
                                The separate treatment of these workers is evident; with Singapore striving to transit to a “new normal” and many looking forward to further easing of pandemic-related 
                                restrictions, the situation has not changed much for the 275,000-odd migrant workers living in dormitories.</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Since last year, the workers have been mostly confined to their rooms due to the restrictions imposed, and only allowed to 
                                leave for work or, for stipulated recreation centres on some days. This has <strong style="color: #404040;">impacted their mental health negatively⁹</strong>. In view of this, as well as their poor living 
                                conditions, participants can consider possible actions that we can take to improve their situation. Community projects that participants can contemplate include 
                                meaningful engagement sessions with the migrant workers and raising more awareness about the plight of the migrant workers. </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Other issues include questions <strong style="color: #404040;">about hygiene in the dormitories</strong>. Factory Converted Dormitories (“FCDs”) – a type of accommodation 
                                that is already regulated by the FEDA – are plagued by serious hygiene-related issues. During the 2021 Committee of Supply, it was revealed that stray animals were found 
                                to freely roam in certain FCD kitchens, in addition to unclean food preparation and disposal areas.¹⁰</p>

                                A forum letter published in Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao blamed the Covid-19 outbreak in dormitories on migrant workers' personal hygiene and living habits.
