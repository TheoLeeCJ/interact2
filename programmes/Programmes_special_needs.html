                                holds one of the lowest disability employment rates amongst developed cities in the world with only 4.9% of Persons 
                                With Disabilities (PWDs) employed in the workforce, while those without disabilities had a 76.5% employment rate. This means that only 
                                5 out of every 100 PWDs are participating in the workforce and we are missing out on a potential workforce of 160, 000 people. </p>

                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>PWDs can be on the receiving end of uncivil language and uncouth behaviour in 
                                the workplace where coworkers may make jokes about their disability. Colleagues may also easily lose their patience,

                                PWDs may be denied training opportunities awarded to all employees, and promotions may be offered to other less qualified employees who are not PWDs </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'><i>Social Exclusion </i></p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>There may be communication barriers between PWDs and their coworkers resulting in social exclusion of PWDs, such as them being 
                                ignored when they ask for clarifications, or alienation where PWDs are not included in social gatherings </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify uk-text-bold'>Workplace Discrimination: Facilities and accommodation </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Employers might not understand the need for job redesign so some provide less than ideal accommodations. Some employers hire 
                                people with disabilities without fully preparing to accommodate them, thinking that routine ways of doing things will work. 
                                However, lack of accommodations leaves PWDs unable to work effectively, or at all. Yet, such accommodations are often inexpensive 
                                or easy to implement. </p>
                            
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify uk-text-bold'>Workplace Discrimination: Indirect Discrimination  </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>There are several examples of indirect discrimination. For instance, colleagues and employers indirectly discriminate when they 
                                fail to respond to incidents of discrimination. </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>This may also involve paternalistic or patronising attitudes. Coworkers put on a veneer of benevolence while interacting with 
                                PWDs, and may treat PWDs as if they are incapable of making good judgements or decisions. Coworkers or superiors may refuse to assign certain tasks they deem PWDs 
                                incapable of executing without letting them try or asking their opinion</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Colleagues and supervisors may not be as understanding towards the limitations of PWDs’ disabilities, and may not accommodate their needs effectively. </p>

                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify uk-text-bold'>Consequences</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Feelings of alienation can negatively impact PWD’s mental health, while those with chronic mental illnesses can suffer a deteriorating condition. Many PWDs 
                                who have experienced workplace discrimination reported feeling “worthless”, and start doubting themself because they feel that no matter what they do, it is not good enough to be respected as and 
                                treated as their non-disabled counterparts. </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>As a result of unpleasant working experiences, PWDs may start to be distrustful of future places of employment, and instead prefer to work alone. This may 
                                exacerbate their social alienation, and above negative implications. </p>

                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>People with disabilities are far less likely to be employed. Singapore 
                                holds one of the lowest disability employment rates amongst developed cities in the world with only 4.9% of Persons 
                                With Disabilities (PWDs) employed in the workforce, while those without disabilities had a 76.5% employment rate. This means that only 
                                5 out of every 100 PWDs are participating in the workforce and we are missing out on a potential workforce of 160, 000 people. </p>

                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>PWDs can be on the receiving end of uncivil language and uncouth behaviour in 
                                the workplace where coworkers may make jokes about their disability. Colleagues may also easily lose their patience, 
                                or make degrading remarks. </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'><i>Unequal remuneration, recognition and training opportunities¹ </i></p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>PWDs may be paid less for doing the same work as, or sometimes doing even more work than their non-disabled peers. 
                                PWDs may be denied training opportunities awarded to all employees, and promotions may be offered to other less qualified employees who are not PWDs </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'><i>Social Exclusion </i></p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>There may be communication barriers between PWDs and their coworkers resulting in social exclusion of PWDs, such as them being 
                                ignored when they ask for clarifications, or alienation where PWDs are not included in social gatherings </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify uk-text-bold'>Workplace Discrimination: Facilities and accommodation </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Employers might not understand the need for job redesign so some provide less than ideal accommodations. Some employers hire 
                                people with disabilities without fully preparing to accommodate them, thinking that routine ways of doing things will work. 
                                However, lack of accommodations leaves PWDs unable to work effectively, or at all. Yet, such accommodations are often inexpensive 
                                or easy to implement. </p>
                            
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify uk-text-bold'>Workplace Discrimination: Indirect Discrimination  </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>There are several examples of indirect discrimination. For instance, colleagues and employers indirectly discriminate when they 
                                fail to respond to incidents of discrimination. </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>This may also involve paternalistic or patronising attitudes. Coworkers put on a veneer of benevolence while interacting with 
                                PWDs, and may treat PWDs as if they are incapable of making good judgements or decisions. Coworkers or superiors may refuse to assign certain tasks they deem PWDs 
                                incapable of executing without letting them try or asking their opinion</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Colleagues and supervisors may not be as understanding towards the limitations of PWDs’ disabilities, and may not accommodate their needs effectively. </p>

                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify uk-text-bold'>Consequences</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Feelings of alienation can negatively impact PWD’s mental health, while those with chronic mental illnesses can suffer a deteriorating condition. Many PWDs 
                                who have experienced workplace discrimination reported feeling “worthless”, and start doubting themself because they feel that no matter what they do, it is not good enough to be respected as and 
                                treated as their non-disabled counterparts. </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>As a result of unpleasant working experiences, PWDs may start to be distrustful of future places of employment, and instead prefer to work alone. This may 
                                exacerbate their social alienation, and above negative implications. </p>

                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>The difficulties faced by PWDs also cause ripple effects in their communities, in the form of 
                                the troubles and obstacles that their caregivers face.</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>37% of caregivers in Singapore have been providing care for over a decade. Studies have revealed our caregivers 
                                face higher mental health risks. Among carers of stroke survivors, 40.2% have depressive symptoms. 4 in 10 caregivers reported feeling psychologically 
                                distressed, with 6 in 10 feeling burdened by caregiving. Family caregivers have been shown to be less likely to attend to their own health and self-care needs, 
                                negatively affecting their well-being. </p>
                            
                            
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify uk-text-bold'>Causes of Caregiver Burnout</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>The stress of caregiving accumulates over time. If left unchecked, physical, emotional and mental exhaustion can cause burnout. Caregivers often prioritise PWDs’ needs and interests, neglecting their own wellbeing. Caregivers also feel the discrimination faced by PWDs. </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Having unrealistic expectations may contribute to caregivers’ stress. They may expect their loved one’s condition to improve from their care. However, this may not be possible for those with progressive conditions such as dementia.</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Caregiver stress may also arise from lack of support or pressure and expectations from family. Sole caregivers may not have adequate support for them to take breaks. Unrealistic demands and expectations of other family members may add on to caregivers’ stress.  </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Many caregivers, such as working caregivers and the sandwich generation also have to manage multiple commitments and responsibilities.</p>

                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify uk-text-bold'>Issues that Caregivers face</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'><i>Anger and frustration</i></p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>It can be distressing to put one's life on hold to care for someone else. The financial difficulties associated with caring for PWDs, and difficulties of care may also be frustrating. </p>

                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'><i>Depression</i></p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Between 40% and 70% of family caregivers experience symptoms of depression. This can be due to lack of self care, isolation and loneliness faced by caregivers.</p>

                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'><i>Physical strain</i></p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Caregivers may not have time to take care of themselves. This includes exercising, eating properly and getting sufficient rest. </p>
                            
                            
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify uk-text-bold'>Lack of Understanding of Caregivers within Community 	</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Many do not understand caregivers’ sacrifices and their burnout. Caregivers may struggle with the loss of income as they leave their jobs or work fewer hours. Hence, some are rude when affected by PWDs. Caregivers also acutely feel discrimination faced by PWDs in their care. </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Caregivers may require leave or flexible schedules. Caregiver discrimination is when employers deny caregiver employers leave or retaliate against them for taking leave. Employers often terminate employees because of their caregiver status, assuming caregivers are less competent or committed. </p>

                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Therapy may help caregivers better cope with isolation, grief and stress that they face. Respite care allows caregivers to take a break from caregiving, but can be costly. Many caregivers feel guilty for not attending to their loved one. </p>
                            <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-break uk-text-bold">Community support</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Caregivers of children with autism have set up initiatives such as NeuroDiverCity, a website which gathers and shares services and resources that parents can review.</p>

                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>The difficulties faced by PWDs also cause ripple effects in their communities, in the form of 
                                the troubles and obstacles that their caregivers face.</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>37% of caregivers in Singapore have been providing care for over a decade. Studies have revealed our caregivers 
                                face higher mental health risks. Among carers of stroke survivors, 40.2% have depressive symptoms. 4 in 10 caregivers reported feeling psychologically 
                                distressed, with 6 in 10 feeling burdened by caregiving. Family caregivers have been shown to be less likely to attend to their own health and self-care needs, 
                                negatively affecting their well-being. </p>
                            
                            
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify uk-text-bold'>Causes of Caregiver Burnout</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>The stress of caregiving accumulates over time. If left unchecked, physical, emotional and mental exhaustion can cause burnout. Caregivers often prioritise PWDs’ needs and interests, neglecting their own wellbeing. Caregivers also feel the discrimination faced by PWDs. </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Having unrealistic expectations may contribute to caregivers’ stress. They may expect their loved one’s condition to improve from their care. However, this may not be possible for those with progressive conditions such as dementia.</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Caregiver stress may also arise from lack of support or pressure and expectations from family. Sole caregivers may not have adequate support for them to take breaks. Unrealistic demands and expectations of other family members may add on to caregivers’ stress.  </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Many caregivers, such as working caregivers and the sandwich generation also have to manage multiple commitments and responsibilities.</p>

                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify uk-text-bold'>Issues that Caregivers face</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'><i>Anger and frustration</i></p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>It can be distressing to put one's life on hold to care for someone else. The financial difficulties associated with caring for PWDs, and difficulties of care may also be frustrating. </p>

                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'><i>Depression</i></p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Between 40% and 70% of family caregivers experience symptoms of depression. This can be due to lack of self care, isolation and loneliness faced by caregivers.</p>

                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'><i>Physical strain</i></p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Caregivers may not have time to take care of themselves. This includes exercising, eating properly and getting sufficient rest. </p>
                            
                            
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify uk-text-bold'>Lack of Understanding of Caregivers within Community 	</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Many do not understand caregivers’ sacrifices and their burnout. Caregivers may struggle with the loss of income as they leave their jobs or work fewer hours. Hence, some are rude when affected by PWDs. Caregivers also acutely feel discrimination faced by PWDs in their care. </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Caregivers may require leave or flexible schedules. Caregiver discrimination is when employers deny caregiver employers leave or retaliate against them for taking leave. Employers often terminate employees because of their caregiver status, assuming caregivers are less competent or committed. </p>

                            <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-break uk-text-bold">Technical Support</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Therapy may help caregivers better cope with isolation, grief and stress that they face. Respite care allows caregivers to take a break from caregiving, but can be costly. Many caregivers feel guilty for not attending to their loved one. </p>
                            <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-break uk-text-bold">Community support</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Caregivers of children with autism have set up initiatives such as NeuroDiverCity, a website which gathers and shares services and resources that parents can review.</p>
                            <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-break uk-text-bold">‘Caregivers’ Space’ </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Caregivers' Space serves as a meeting place for peer support groups, training of caregivers of PWDs, and engagement sessions by Voluntary Welfare Organisations as well as community partners. </p>
