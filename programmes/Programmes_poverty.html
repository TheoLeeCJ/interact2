                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>For food insecurity, many elderly remain food insecure despite over a hundred food assistance groups providing aid. 
                                Firstly, the lack of standardisation and official information such as household distribution of poverty and a central database on charities for each area 
                                results in some households (especially seniors) being overserved while others are underserved. Such food assistance are also irregular as they are unable 
                                to function as a fully-fledged food charity, leaving households worrying about a reliable food source. </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Next, the lack of feedback channels not only results in households receiving inappropriate foods for their nutritional 
                                needs or their physical limitations, bringing more health problems and food wastage. On the recipients' side, not wanting to seem ungrateful prevents them 
                                from providing valuable feedback voluntarily. </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Lastly, food charities are restricted by the donations received, which often include unhealthy canned food or excessive non-perishables with a long shelf life. </p>

                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-center'><i style="color:#404040; font-family: Times;">“Holding up a can of fried dace fish with black beans, Fion sighed: “This is deep fried, it’s salty, it’s preserved. Aunty already has the three ‘highs’. Let me tell you frankly. If she eats all these, it is a slow suicide.”</i></p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Seeing that food insecurity is a more community-based problem, how can both the (i) general public (donors) and (ii) charities better support them? Consider partnerships with various stakeholders (government, businesses, schools etc) and how other countries approached these problems.</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Current policies include Pioneer Generation Package, Central Provision Fund Lifelong Income For the Elderly (CPF LIFE) and the Silver Support Scheme and additional support under ComCare.</p>

                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>For food insecurity, many elderly remain food insecure despite over a hundred food assistance groups providing aid. 
                                Firstly, the lack of standardisation and official information such as household distribution of poverty and a central database on charities for each area 
                                results in some households (especially seniors) being overserved while others are underserved. Such food assistance are also irregular as they are unable 
                                to function as a fully-fledged food charity, leaving households worrying about a reliable food source. </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Next, the lack of feedback channels not only results in households receiving inappropriate foods for their nutritional 
                                needs or their physical limitations, bringing more health problems and food wastage. On the recipients' side, not wanting to seem ungrateful prevents them 
                                from providing valuable feedback voluntarily. </p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Lastly, food charities are restricted by the donations received, which often include unhealthy canned food or excessive non-perishables with a long shelf life. </p>

                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-center'><i style="color:#404040; font-family: Times;">“Holding up a can of fried dace fish with black beans, Fion sighed: “This is deep fried, it’s salty, it’s preserved. Aunty already has the three ‘highs’. Let me tell you frankly. If she eats all these, it is a slow suicide.”</i></p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Seeing that food insecurity is a more community-based problem, how can both the (i) general public (donors) and (ii) charities better support them? Consider partnerships with various stakeholders (government, businesses, schools etc) and how other countries approached these problems.</p>
                            <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Current policies include Pioneer Generation Package, Central Provision Fund Lifelong Income For the Elderly (CPF LIFE) and the Silver Support Scheme and additional support under ComCare.</p>

                                assistance schemes, this does not take into account specifically the unwed parents nor temporary single parents, but it already 
                                indicates the significant proportion of non-nuclear families. Since most schemes support nuclear families, single parent households 
                                tend to fall through the gaps.</p>

                                families in rental housing. Firstly, <strong style="color: #404040;">Comlink Alliance</strong>, which is led by MSF’s Social Service Office (SSO) consists of 
                                various partner agencies and volunteers, will closely support each family with regular check-ins and customise support 
                                according to their needs. Secondly, Comlink Alliance brings together government agencies, the private sector and volunteers, 
                                collating different programmes benefiting both children and adults. It also acts as a platform to coordinate large-scale

                                find possible NGOs providing emotional and practical support or online social support groups, which is a time-consuming and 
                                draining process especially with the existing burden of becoming a single parent. </p>

                                <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Secondly, race-based self-help groups were set up in such a way so as to encourage each ethnic group to be responsible 
                                    for its own success, and to encourage self-reliance. These groups were founded on the belief that each racial group would be best aware of the problems 
                                    through their community’s cultural and ethnic lens and were best able to address them. The four self-help groups are the Chinese Development Assistance 
                                    Council, the Singapore Indian Development Association (Sinda), Yayasan Mendaki and the Eurasian Association. As the funding from these groups primarily comes 
                                    from their own communities via individual CPF donation, where the higher the income earned, the more they donate. However, this may continue to perpetuate 
                                    inequality as communities in the lead can maintain that advantage by virtue of having more to give.</p>

                                    HDB towns based on the ethnic make-up of Singapore. Since the EIP aims to promote racial integration and prevent racial enclaves, if Chinese residents in estates

                                    lower-paying jobs, for example majority of Malay workers are concentrated in lower rung vocations prone to unemployment,

                                    then certainly there are some things that make it a little easier for you”. — Dr Mathew Matthews, IPS Principal Researcher</i></p>
                                <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Do you think Chinese privilege exists? If yes, should examples which support such privilege be abolished or adapted 
                                    (eg. SAP schools)? If no, how do you propose we address such discrepancies not specifically targeted at any race, but arise from being a majority?</p>
                                <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify uk-text-bold'>Race-based Self Help Groups</p>
                                <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Secondly, race-based self-help groups were set up in such a way so as to encourage each ethnic group to be responsible 
                                    for its own success, and to encourage self-reliance. These groups were founded on the belief that each racial group would be best aware of the problems 
                                    through their community’s cultural and ethnic lens and were best able to address them. The four self-help groups are the Chinese Development Assistance 
                                    Council, the Singapore Indian Development Association (Sinda), Yayasan Mendaki and the Eurasian Association. As the funding from these groups primarily comes 
                                    from their own communities via individual CPF donation, where the higher the income earned, the more they donate. However, this may continue to perpetuate 
                                    inequality as communities in the lead can maintain that advantage by virtue of having more to give.</p>

                                    having an advantage? If yes, how should the government support them and how can we address possible tensions that may arise?</p>

                                <p class='uk-text-break uk-text-justify'>Lastly, the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) is an ethnic residential quota system set at block or neighbourhood levels of 
                                    HDB towns based on the ethnic make-up of Singapore. Since the EIP aims to promote racial integration and prevent racial enclaves, if Chinese residents in estates 
                                    exceed the quota, ethnic minorities cannot sell to Chinese buyers who are the largest groups of potential buyers. Hence, these minorities will suffer from either a 
                                    prolonged period without a suitable buyer or accept a lower selling price, which exacerbates the income inequality. Additionally, sale prices for racial group-constrained 
                                    HDB resale units were different, where Chinese-constrained properties were more expensive than Indian or Malay-constrained properties, directly proving the discriminatory impact of EIP.</p>
